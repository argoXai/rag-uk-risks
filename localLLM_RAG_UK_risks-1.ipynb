      "Based on the provided documents, I have identified the following principal risks and uncertainties facing the company:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Competitive risk**: The company is a design provider and faces competitive risks due to its reliance on providing design services to other group entities under an agreement that provides for a mark-up on operating costs. This risk is considered to be directly linked to the success of the wider group.\n",
      "\n",
      "Description: The company's primary source of revenue comes from providing design services to other group entities, which exposes it to competitive risks. The company's ability to maintain its market share and pricing power depends on its ability to deliver high-quality designs and services that meet the needs of its clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Financial risk management**: The company faces financial risks related to foreign currency, credit, and liquidity risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Description: The company has variable rate borrowings outstanding, which exposes it to interest rate risk. Additionally, the company's operations are conducted in multiple currencies, which exposes it to foreign exchange risk. The company also relies on external funding sources, which increases its credit risk. Finally, the company's ability to meet its financial obligations depends on its liquidity position.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Credit risk**: The company faces credit risks due to its reliance on external funding sources and variable rate borrowings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Description: The company's creditworthiness is dependent on its ability to generate cash flows and maintain a strong balance sheet. Any deterioration in the company's creditworthiness could impact its access to capital markets and increase its borrowing costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Liquidity risk**: The company faces liquidity risks due to its reliance on external funding sources and variable rate borrowings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Description: The company's ability to meet its financial obligations depends on its liquidity position. Any unexpected changes in the company's cash flows or funding requirements could impact its ability to meet its short-term obligations.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Foreign exchange risk**: The company faces foreign exchange risks due to its operations being conducted in multiple currencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Description: The company's exposure to foreign exchange risks arises from its transactions denominated in currencies other than its functional currency. Any changes in exchange rates could impact the company's revenue, expenses, and profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Interest rate risk**: The company faces interest rate risks due to its variable rate borrowings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Description: The company's exposure to interest rate risks arises from its variable rate borrowings. Any changes in interest rates could impact the company's borrowing costs and cash flows.\n",
      "\n",
