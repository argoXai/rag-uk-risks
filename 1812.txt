STRATEGIC REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023

The directors present their annual report and the audited financial statements of Quantum Clothing
Group Limited for the year ended 31 March 2023.

REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES

The directors aim to present a balanced and comprehensive review of the development and
performance of the business during the year and its position at the year end. This review is consistent
with the size and nature of the business and is written in the context of the risks and uncertainties that
the business faces.

The Company’s principal activities are to provide designing services to its Group companies based in
Sri Lanka and Hong Kong.

During the last financial year Sri Lanka faced a balance of payment crisis and declared a soft default on
its sovereign and bilateral debt portfolios. Ever since the default the country has been going through a
severe economic crisis. This has resulted in hyperinflation, essential shortages, day to day disruptions
to life, etc. As the wider group is mainly operated out of Sri Lanka, the manufacturing operations in Sri
Lanka were disrupted to a certain extent with shortages in fuel, power cuts, etc. However as the
apparel industry is one of the main export revenue generators of Sri Lanka, the government has
supported the industry and the group has been able to carry out the operations without any
interruptions. With strong debt restructuring measures, government policy & institute reforms Sri
Lanka is planning to quickly turnaround the situation. Also with the world opening its borders after the
pandemic, the country is seeing increased number of tourists arriving which will further strengthen
the countries’ Forex reserves.

The wider group has also experienced difficulties in procuring the necessary raw materials for
production as the suppliers are refusing to accept letter of credits issued by Sri Lankan banks, etc.
However the main trading business of the group “Inqube Global” has a strong financial position and
was able to fund the procurement through cash advances in the short term and through supply chain
financing arrangements with the customers in the longer term.

The company operates as the apparel design expert to the wider group. The main trading and
manufacturing arms of the wider group operates out of Sri Lanka. The success of the company depends
on the success of the wider group and the situation of the apparel industry in Sri Lanka.

As a design service provider to the group the company is therefore dependent upon the fortunes of
the wider group for its business. As such the directors, who also have access to financial information
relating to the trading and prospects of the wider group, continue to monitor closely the impact of
unfolding events across the group in order to respond swiftly to any consequential implications on the
business.

STRATEGIC REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023 (CONTINUED)
REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES (CONTINUED)

The directors consider that the key financial performance indicators are those that communicate the
financial performance of the company as a whole, these being revenue, the operating profit/(loss) and
profit/(!oss) for the year, which are as follows:

2023 2022 Change
USD USD %
’000 ‘000 -
Continuing operations
Revenue 1,673 1,276 31.10%
Operating profit 97 97 0.00%
Profit (before tax) for the financial year 94 74 27.03%

The operations of the company shows a 31.1% increase in revenue compared to the previous year. The
operating profit remains consistent with the previous year. totalling $97,000 in profit.

The increase in revenue is mainly due to the increase in operating expenses of the company. QCGL
earns an arm’s length margin on operating costs as QCGL provides its design services to group
companies. Hence if there is an increase in operating expenses the revenue also increases.

As at the 31 March 2023 the Company had net assets of $1,793,000 (2022: net assets $1,625,000).

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

The company has a senior management committee that meets monthly and which evaluates the
company’s risks and considers the mitigating actions required to manage risk within the agreed risk
appetite.

The principal risks and uncertainties facing the company are broadly considered to relate to
competitive risk (which is directly linked to the success of the wider group) and financial risk
management, which covers exposure to foreign currency, credit and liquidity risk.

Competitive risks

Being a design provider, the company is mainly providing design services to other group entities under
an agreement which provides for a mark-up on operating costs, minimizing the previously associated
competitive risks. The service provided to third parties are comparatively minimal further decreasing
the competitive risks. .

Financial risk management

The principal financial instruments used by the company comprise trade payables, intercompany
balances, and bank balances. The main purpose of these financial instruments are to manage working
capital and maintain liquidity for the company’s operations.

The company is exposed to a variety of financial risks including currency, credit and liquidity risk.

STRATEGIC REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023 (CONTINUED)
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES (CONTINUED)

Foreign exchange risk

The company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as its UK payroll and certain expenses
are denominated in GBP and EUR. A senior management committee, which has been in place for
several years, considers this exposure on a regular basis. The foreign exchange markets are
reviewed on a daily basis by reference to various institutional reports which are considered
alongside weekly reviews with the bankers and independent foreign exchange advisors.

Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will default causing a financial loss
for that other party by failing to discharge an obligation. Being a design service provider, primarily
to other group companies, most of the customers are group entities and the credit risk becomes
comparatively low when compared to previous years. However, in the case of third party sales,
credit risks will remain in respect of amounts due, and this risk is managed by the group treasury
function.

Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated
with financial liabilities. The company manages liquidity risk via the support provided by other
group companies through intercompany payables.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023

The directors present their annual report and the audited financial statements for the year ended 31
March 2023.

GOING CONCERN

In the opinion of directors, it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern
basis as, the company is now making profits by providing apparel design services to the group.
(retaining a fixed margin on services provided as per the transfer pricing agreement between the
company and the related parties) and is expected to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.

This arrangement supports the directors’ assessment that the company will generate profits and, will
be able to settle its obligations as and when they fall due.

In forming this judgement, the directors recognise that there continues to be uncertainty related to
the impact of the economic crisis in Sri Lanka on the wider group, including the company. The
operations of the company and provision of design services is dependent on the success of the wider

group, including to the extent of orders it receives from external customers, securing | ng enough inventory

“to facilitate orders and remittancés to suppliers. ~~ > ~ > Beene

On the basis of their enquiries, the directors consider that the potential impact of the Sri Lankan
economic crisis on the trading prospects and cash flows of the wider group will be mitigated by strict
cost control initiatives and the recovery of the country from the economic crisis through national policy

"reforms and cuts in government spending, privatization, etc fairly quickly. Also global events such as

the Russia/Ukraine war, Israel/Palestine conflict and their impacts on the group were considered in
forming the going concern assessment for the company. Accordingly, the directors are satisfied that
the wider group will continue to require the services of the company, will be able to fund them and it
is appropriate to prepare these financial statements on a going concern basis.

FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

As the competition in the industry gets tougher, the company and the wider group’s focus is on
continued innovation and new product introduction beyond intimates wear, with focus on sportswear
and athleisure business, which is expected to drive sales outside the European market with significant
focus on US & Canadian customers. The shift in portfolio towards US & Canadian markets and the new
products with higher margin is expected to drive increased group profitability.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF QUANTUM CLOTHING
GROUP LIMITED

Qualified opinion on the financial statements
In our opinion, except for the possible effects of the matter described in the basis for qualified opinion
section of our report, the financial statements:

¢ give a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs as at 31 March 2023 and of its profit
for the year then ended;

© have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice; and

© have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements of Quantum Clothing Group Limited (“the Company”) for the year
ended 31 March 2023 which comprise the income statement, the statement of financial position, the
statement of changes in equity and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant
~ “accounting ‘policies: The’ financial reporting framework-that has been applied_in their preparation is
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

Basis for qualified opinion

We were unable to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to support the classification of $356,813 legal
and professional fees recognised as operating expenses. We were unable to satisfy ourselves by alternative
means concerning the classification of these fees by using other audit procedures. Consequently, we were
unable to determine whether any adjustment to this amount was necessary or whether there was any
consequential adjustment to creditors or related balances.

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified opinion.

Independence

We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our
audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events
or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue
as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised
for issue.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF QUANTUM CLOTHING
GROUP LIMITED (CONTINUED) :

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in
the relevant sections of this report.

Other information

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information
included in the Annual report and financial statements, other than the financial statements and our auditor's
report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except
to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion
thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course
of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or
apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material
misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude
that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

As described in the basis for qualified opinion section of our report, we were unable to satisfy ourselves
concerning the classification of legal and professional fees recognised as operating expenses as at 31 March
2023. We have concluded that where the other information refers to the operating expenses balance or
related balances such as creditors, it may be materially misstated for the same reason.

Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
Except for the possible effects of the matter described in the basis for qualified opinion section of our report,
in our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

© the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which
the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

© the Strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

Except for the possible effects of the matter described in the basis for qualified opinion section of our report,
in the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course
of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic report or the Directors’ report.

Arising solely from the limitation on the scope of our work relating to operating expenses, referred to above:

© we have not obtained all the information and explanations that we considered necessary for the
purpose of our audit; and

© we were unable to determine whether adequate accounting records have been kept.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF QUANTUM CLOTHING
GROUP LIMITED (CONTINUED)

e returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

e the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

¢ certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made.
Responsibilities of Directors

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in respect of the Financial Statements,
the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they
give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

in preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Company or to cease
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted
in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial
statements.

Extent to which the audit was capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design
procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of
irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities,
including fraud is detailed below:

Non-compliance with laws and regulations
Based on:

- @ Ourunderstanding of the Company and the industry in which it operates;
e Discussion with management and those charged with governance;
© Obtaining and understanding of the Company's policies and procedures regarding compliance with
laws and regulations; and

we considered the significant laws and regulations to be the applicable accounting framework, the
Companies Act 2006, corporate taxes, VAT legislation and employment taxes.

Page 11


Page 14 Text:
QUANTUM CLOTHING GROUP LIMITED (Company Registration No. 0001812)

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF QUANTUM CLOTHING
GROUP LIMITED (CONTINUED)

The Company is also subject to laws and regulations where the consequence of non-compliance could have
a material effect on the amount or disclosures in the financial statements, for example through the
imposition of fines or litigations. We identified such laws and regulations to be health and safety legislation
and the Bribery Act 2010.

Our procedures in respect of the above included:

e Review of minutes of meeting of those charged with governance for any instances of non-
compliance with laws and regulations;

© Review of correspondence with tax authorities for any instances of non-compliance with laws and
regulations;

e Review of financial statement disclosures and agreeing to supporting documentation;
Involvement of tax specialists in the audit;

© Review of legal expenditure accounts to understand the nature of expenditure incurred.

Fraud

We assessed the susceptibility of the financial statements to material misstatement, including fraud. Our
risk assessment procedures included:

e Enquiry with management and those charged with governance regarding any known or suspected
instances of fraud; :
© Obtaining an understanding of the Company’s policies and procedures relating to:
o Detecting and responding to the risks of fraud; and
co Internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud.
e Review of minutes of meeting of those charged with governance for any known or suspected
instances of fraud;
© Discussion amongst the engagement team as to how and where fraud might occur in the financial
statements;
© Performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may
indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud;
© Considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets and the related financial
statement areas impacted by these.

Based on our risk assessment, we considered the areas most susceptible to fraud to be management
override of controls and revenue recognition, specifically the manipulation of revenue using fraudulent
journals.

Our procedures in respect of the above included:

e Testing a sample of journal entries throughout the year, which met a defined risk criteria, by
agreeing to supporting documentation;

e Reviewed the Company’s accounting policies for non-compliance with relevant standards. Our
work also included considering significant accounting estimate for evidence of misstatement or
possible bias and testing any significant transactions that appeared to be outside the normal
course of business.

Page 15 Text:
QUANTUM CLOTHING GROUP LIMITED (company Registration No. 0001812)

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF QUANTUM CLOTHING
GROUP LIMITED (CONTINUED)

We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement
team members who were all deemed to have appropriate competence and capabilities and remained alert
to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.

Our audit procedures were designed to respond to risks of material misstatement in the financial statements,
recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not
detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery,
misrepresentations or through collusion. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures performed
and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions
reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we are to become aware of it. In addition, the extent to
which the audit was capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud was limited by the matter described
in the basis for qualified opinion section of our report.

A further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at:

https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Use of our report

This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we
have formed.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023 (CONTINUED)

2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

2.1 Basis of preparation (continued)

Quantum Clothing Lanka (Pvt) Limited is the immediate parent company of the group and it is
incorporated in Sri Lanka. Quantum Clothing Group Limited has a wholly owned subsidiary namely
Quantum Apparel Cambodia Limited which is incorporated in Cambodia. The Company has applied
Companies Act 2006 section 401 “exemption from the obligation to prepare and deliver group
accounts”. Both Quantum Clothing Group Limited and Quantum Apparel Cambodia Limited are being
consolidated at Quantum Clothing Lanka (Pvt) Limited level. These consolidated financial statements
are prepared in accordance with Sri Lanka Financial Reporting Standards (SLFRSs and LKASs) which
falls under “Other GAAP closely related to IFRS”. Copies of consolidated financial statements are
available to the public and may be obtained from Companies House, Crown Way, Cardiff CF14 3UZ.

Going concern
The Company made a profit before tax for the year of $94,000 (2022 profit: $74,000) and has
net assets of $1,793,000 (2022: net assets $1,625,000) at the financial year end.

The directors have prepared detailed trading forecasts for the Company for a period of more
than 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements (going concern
assessment period is 1st April 2023 to 31st March 2027).

The business model (receiving a fixed margin on services provided to group companies as per
the transfer pricing agreement between the company and the related parties) supports the
directors’ assessment that the Company will generate profits and will be able to settle its
obligations as and when they fall due.

In forming this judgement, the directors recognise that there continues to be uncertainty
related to the impact of the economic crisis in Sri Lanka on the wider group, including the
company. The operations of the company and provision of design services is dependent on
the success of the wider group, including the extent of orders it receives from external
customers. On the basis of their enquiries, the directors consider that the potential impact of
the Sri Lankan economic crisis on the trading prospects and cash flows of the wider group will
be mitigated by strict cost control initiatives and the recovery of the country from the
economic crisis through national policy reforms and cuts in government spending,
privatization, etc fairly quickly. Accordingly, the directors are satisfied that the wider group will
continue to require the services of the company, will be able to fund them and it is appropriate
to prepare these financial statements on a going concern basis.

Accordingly, as at the date of approval of these financial statements, the directors have a
reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue to operate and settle its
debts as they fall due and therefore the adoption of the going concern basis of preparation is
considered appropriate. .

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023 (CONTINUED)

2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

2.2 Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentational currency

Items included in the financial statements of the company are measured using the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates (‘the
functional currency’). The financial statements are presented in United States Dollar

(USD), which is also the company’s functional currency.
(b) Transactions and balances

Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into United States Dollar
at the rate ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into United
States Dollar at the rates ruling at that date. Translation differences are dealt with in the

profit and foss account.

A sterling exchange rate of 1.2002 USD/GBP has. been used for translation purposes within the

statement of financial position as at 31 March 2023 (2022: 1.3579 USD/GBP).

2.3 Property plant and equipment

Tangible assets are stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes the
original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working

condition for its intended life.

Depreciation is provided on cost in equal annual instalments over the estimated useful lives of

the assets. The rates of depreciation are as follows:

Leasehold improvements 10% per annum

Vehicles and machinery 10% - 25% per annum

Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 10% per annum

Right of use assets Based on the shorter of the lease period and the
useful life

2.4 Trade and other receivables

Trade receivables are measured at amortised cost. Impairment provisions for trade receivables
are recognised based on the simplified approach within the IFRS 9 using a provision matrix in
the determination of the lifetime expected credit losses. This assessment includes the
consideration of historic trends together with the current and expected future performance of
the counterparties. The probability of non-payment of trade receivables is assessed and then

multiplied by the amount expected loss to determine lifetime of ECL.
2.5 Creditors

Creditors are obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary

course of business from suppliers.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023 (CONTINUED)

2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

2.6 Borrowings
Any interest-bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest rate method, which ensures that any interest expense over period of
repayment is at a constant rate.

2.7 Borrowing costs
All finance costs are recognised in profit and loss in the period in which they are incurred.

2.8 Current and deferred income tax
Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the rate prevailing in the year.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been
- ....-.. enacted or substantively enacted by the r reporting date i in n the c countries where the company’s

subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. wee Seen re ee

Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance
sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply
when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Timing differences arise from the
inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from
those in which they are included in financial statements.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded, as more likely than not that
they will be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.

2.9 Revenue recognition
Provision of design services

Revenue generated from the provision of design services is measured at the fair value of the
consideration received or receivable when performance obligations are satisfied and represents
the amount receivable for services provided, net of value added taxes. Performance obligations
are satisfied, when the standards and specifications of designs provided to the customer are met
and the pre-agreed timelines are met by the company.

Most of the company’s design service revenue is derived from fixed price contracts and
therefore the amount of revenue to be earned from each contract is determined by reference
to those fixed prices. There is no significant judgement made in determining the point at which
control transfers and there are no arrangements that would give rise to variable consideration.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023 (CONTINUED)

2 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)

2.10 Pensions

The company operates a defined contribution pension plan for certain employees. A defined
contribution plan is a pension plan under which the company pays contributions to a separate
entity in accordance with the terms of the plan. Once paid, the company has no legal or

constructive obligations to make any further contributions.

2.11 Impairment

Non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying
value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of value in use and fair value
less costs to sell), the asset is written down accordingly. Impairment charges are included in
profit or loss, except to the extent they reverse gains previously recognised in other

comprehensive income.

2.12 Leases and right of use assets

At inception of a contract, the company assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A
contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified

asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

When a lease is identified the company recognises a right of use asset and a lease liability at the
lease commencement date. The right of use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises
the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease prepayments made at or before
the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to
dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on

which it is located, less any lease incentives received.

The right of use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the
commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right of use asset or the
end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right of use assets are determined on the
same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. In addition, the right of use asset is
periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain re-measurements of

the lease liability.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not
paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if
that rate cannot be readily determined, the company’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease
liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is re-
measured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or
rate, or if the company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension

or termination option.

The company does not present right of use assets and lease liabilities separately in the statement
of financial position. The company has elected not to recognise right of use assets and lease
liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-
value assets. The company recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an

expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

3 Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting
estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the actual results. The directors have not made any
estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances.

Tax credit (74) -

The company has unrecognised tax losses carried forward amounting to $10,468,814 (2022 -
$10,437,066).

With the business model change from entrepreneur to design service provider, the nature of the
company’s trade has gone through a major change and there is significant uncertainty over the
utilization of the carried forward losses.

During the financial year ended 31 March 2021 an evaluation on the carried forward losses has
been carried out by the company together with a 3" party consultant and, as a result, the post-
acquisition losses of $10,445,068 has been carried forward while the balance has been forfeited
under the provisions of CTA 2010 s673. Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences
under the liability method using a tax rate of 19% (2022: 19%).

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary
differences giving rise to deferred tax assets where the directors believe it is probable that these
assets will be recovered based upon business forecasts.

A deferred tax asset of $74,000 (2023: Snil) has been recognised in respect of other temporary
differences.

Income tax (continued)
Factors affecting current and future tax changes

The main rate of corporate tax in force at the Balance Sheet date was 19%. A resolution to retain
corporation tax rate from 1 April 2020 at 19% was passed on 17 March 2020 and is enacted from
this date.

The March 2021 Budget announced a proposed increase to the main rate of corporation tax to
25% from April 2023. Management have assessed the impact of applying the changes in long
term tax rates that have been announced but were not substantively enacted at 31 March 2023
and consider that the impact is not significant.

Impact of Intercompany debt release

On 2nd August 2021, the parent company of QCGL, “Quantum Clothing Lanka Pvt Ltd” issued a
formal deed of waiver in respect of the payable balance of $11,134,000. This waiver has restored
the company’s solvency with net current and net assets now being reported.

The resultant credit is not taxable under the provisions of s358 CTA 2009 as the debt between
the company and Quantum Clothing Lanka (Pvt) Ltd is considered to be a connected company

RNLR. (Relevant non-lending relationship).

Independent auditor’s report

To the Shareholders of Quantum Clothing Lanka (Private) Limited

Report on the audit of the financial statements

Our opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements of Quantum Clothing Lanka (Private) Limited (“the Company”)
and the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) give a true and
fair view of the financial position of the Company and the Group as at 31 March 2023, and of their financial
performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards.

What we have audited

The financial statements of the Company and the consolidated financial statements of the Group, which

e the balance sheet as at 31 March 2023;

the statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;

the statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;

explanatory information.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). Our responsibilities

under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

Independence

We are independent of the Company and the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics for Professional
Accountants issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (“CA Sri Lanka Code of Ethics”),
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code of Ethics.

a

included in the Annual Report of the Board of Directors but does not include the financial statements and
our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any
form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information
identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with
the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially
misstated.

information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Independent auditor’s report
To the Shareholders of Quantum Clothing Lanka (Private) Limited

Report on the audit of the financial statements (Contd)

Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the financial statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in
accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards and, for such internal control as management
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the separate/consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing
the Company’s/Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related
to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to
liquidate the Company/Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s and the Group's financial
reporting process.

‘Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an
audit conducted in accordance with SLAuSs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SLAuSs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain
professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

e Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the
override of internal control.

¢ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's and the Group's internal control.

e Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting,
estimates and related disclosures made by management.

© Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting,
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s/Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention
in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the separate/consolidated financial statements
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions
may cause the Company/Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

{i) Classification as trade and other receivables

Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. They are
generally due for settlement within 30 days and therefore are all classified as current. Trade receivables are recognised initially at the
amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain significant financing components, when they are recognised at fair value.
The Company and the Group hold the trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flaws and therefore measures them
subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Details about the Company's and the Group's impairment policies and
the calculation of the provision for impairment is provided in note 9(b).The Company's and the Group's impairment and other accounting
policies for trade and other recelvables are outlined in notes 20(g).

(il) Fair values of teade and other receivables
Due to the short-term nature of the current receivables, their carrying amount is considered to be the same as their fair value. For the
majority of the non-current receivables, the fair values are also not significantly different to their carrying amounts.

{iii (mpalement aid risk exposure

Information about the impairment of trade and other receivables, their credit quatity and the Group's exposure to credit risk, foreign currency
tisk and interest rate risk can be found in note 9(b).

The total cash outflow for leases in 2022/23 was USD 334,613 (2021/22 USD - 304,995)

(iii) The Company's leasing activities and how these are accounted for;
The Group leases building typically for a fixed period of 10 years.

Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not
impose any covenants other than the security interests in the leased assets that are held by the lessor. Leased assets may not be used as
security for borrowing purposes.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rata implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally
the case far leases in the Group, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay
to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar
terms, security and conditions.

To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group:

- where possible, uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a starting point, adjusted to reflect changes in
financing conditions since third party financing was received

- uses a build-up approach that starts wilh a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for leases held by the Group, which does not have
recent third party financing, and

- makes adjustments spscific to the lease, e.g. term, country, currency and security.

Ifa readily observable amortising loan rate is available to the individual lessee (through recent financing or market data) which has a similar
payment profile to the lease, then the Group entities use that rate as a starting point to determine the incremental borrowing rate.

§ Non-financial assets and liabilities (Contd)

(b) Leases (Contd)

The Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate, which are not included in the lease
liabilily until they take effect. When adjustments to tease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and
adjusted against the right-of-use asset.

Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. If the
Group is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the underlying asset's useful life.

Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and vehicles and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line
basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are teases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise with
any lease asset which value is less than USD 50,000.

(iv) Extension and termination options

Extension and termination ‘options are included in a number of property arid equipment leases across the Group. These are used to
maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group's operations. The majority of extension and termination
options held are exescisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor.

(v) Critical judgements in determining the lease term

In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an econamic incentive to exercise an
extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (of periods after termination options) are only included in the lease
term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated).

The gratuity fiability of the Group is related to the Company and it is based on an actuarial valuation carried out by Actuarial and
Management Consultants (Private) Limited, based on the details provided for the year ended 31 March 2023 whose principal place of the
business is located at 1st floor, 434 R. A. De Mel Mawatha, Cotombo, Sri Lanka.

Significant actuarial assumptions were as follows:

2023 2022
Financial assumptions
Discount rate 15.0% 12.2%
Future salary increase rate
- Executive staff 18.0% 15%
~ Factory staff 15.0% 15%

Mortality table

Mortality Table Mortality Table
Staff turnover rate
- Executive staff Age < 55 11.00% 6.00%
- Other staff Age < 55 43.00% 40.00%

The current yield rate of applicable government bond was adjusted for the market risk premium and the country tating default spread in
deriving the discount rate.

In addition to the above, demographic assumptions, inflation, seniority, promotions and other relevant factors such as supply and demand
factors in the employee market were considered for the actuarial valuation. The estimate of future salary increases was taken into
consideration for the valuation.

The discount rate was determined by adjusting the existing and pre covid default risks premiums to the government bond rate.

Other staff 43.0% 40.0%

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is
unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit
obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected
unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance
sheet.

Risk exposure

Through its defined benefit pension plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the prior period.

Changes in bond yields A decrease in high quality government bond yields will increase plan liabilities.

Inflation risks Some of the Company's pension obligations are linked to salary Inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher
liabilities.
Life expectancy The majority of the plans’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life

expectancy will result in an increase in the plans’ liabilities.

The defined benefit pian comprises the gratuity provided under the payment of Gratuity Act, No.12 of 1983.

The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 4 years (2022 - 5 years). The expected maturity analysis of pension and
post-employment medical benefits is as follows:

Notes to the financial statements

{alt amounts in the notes are in US Dollars unless otherwise stated)

8 Critical estimates, judgements and errors

The preparation of financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates which, by definition, will seldom equal the actual results.
Management also needs to exercise judgement in applying the Group's accounting policies.

This note provides an overview of the areas that involved a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and of items which are more likely
to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be wrong. Detailed information about each of these estimates
and judgements is included In notes 1 to 7 together with information about the basis of calculation for each affected line item in the
financial statements. In addition, this note also explains where there have been actual adjustments this year as a result of an error and of
changes to previous estimates.

(a) Significant estimates and judgements
The areas invalving significant estimates or Judgements are:

- recognition of revenue — note 4

_ estimation of current tax payable and current tax expense — note 3(a)

_ estimated useful life of property plant and equipment assets — note 5(a)

. estimation uncertainties & judgements made in relation to !ease accounting - note 5(b)
. estimated useful life of intangible asset - note 5(c)

_ estimation of defined benefit pension obligations — note 5(e)

- expected credit loss provision for trade receivables — note 9{b)

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated. They are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of
future events that may have a financial impact on the entity and that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

9 Financial risk management

This note explains the Group's exposure to financial risks and how these risks could affect the Group's future financial performance.
Current year profit and loss information has been included where relevant to add further context.

The Group's risk management is carried out by the treasury department under policies approved by the board of directors. Group treasury
identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the operating units. The board provides written principles for
overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange tisk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of
derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.

(a) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk

The Company and the Group is sensitive to the fluctuations in exchange rates and is principally exposed to fluctuations in the value of the
Sri Lankan Rupee (LKR),the British pound sterling (GBP) and the Cambodian riel (KHR) against US Dollar (USD) and, to a tesser extent,
the Euro (EUR). The Group's functional currency is USD in which most of the transactions are denominated, and all other currencies are
considered foreign currencies for reporting purposes. Certain bank balances, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and
borrowings are denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign currencies are used to settle material suppliers and certain other expenses.

(il) Interest rate risk

The borrowings are periodically contractually repriced (see below) and to that extent are also exposed to the risk of future changes in
market interest rates.

The Company's borrowings are mostly in terms of US Dollars, and the Company's interest rate risk arises from fluctuations in LIBOR.
Based on our outlook on LIBOR, the Company takes decisions centrally on whether to swap floating interest rates for fixed interest rates
through interest rate swaps agreements based on recommendations made to the board of directors by the group Treasury.

The exposure of the Company's borrowing to interest rate changes and the contractual re-pricing dates of the fixed interest rate
borrowings at the end of the reporting period are as follows:

(ill) Price risk

The Company and the Group are not expased to price risk.
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to
wholesale and retall customers, including outstanding receivables.
(i) Risk management

Credit risk is managed on a group basis. For bank and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with sound financial
background are accepted. . .

If customers are independently rated, thase ratings are used. Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, risk control assesses the credit
quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors. Individual risk limits are set based on

internal or extemal ratings in accordance with limits set by the management. The compliance with credit limits by customers is regularly
monitored by line management.

(it) Security

For some trade receivables the Company may obtain security in the form of guarantees or letters of credit which can be called upon if the
counterparty is in default under the terms of the agreement.

(b) Credit risk (Contd)

(ii) impairment of financial assets

The Company has the below financial assets that are subject to the expected credit loss model:

(a) Impaired of trade receivables

The Company applies the SLFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credil losses which uses a lifetime expected credit loss
mode! for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and related party receivables have been
grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of
sales over a period of 36 month before 31 March 2023 or 1 April 2022 respectively and the corresponding historical credit losses
experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward looking information on macrceconomic
factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.

The closing loss allowances for trade receivables as at 31 March 2023 reconcile to the opening loss allowances as follows:

‘Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation -
of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with the Company, and a failure to make
contractual payments for a period of greater than 120 days past due.

(ii) Credit quality
The credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired can be assessed by reference to external credit ratings (if
available) or to historical information about counterparty default rates.

(v) Past due but not impaired

As at 31 March 2023, trade receivables of USD 1,165,895 (2022 - USD 1,577,456) past due but not impaired. These relate to a number of
independent customers for whom there is no recent history of default. The ageing analysis of these trade receivables is as follows:

Group Company
2023 2022 2023 2022
Up to 3 months 1,249,679 2,158,110 2,282 560

2,820,611 4,137,843 3,824 1,220,486

The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets and are not past due. Based on the credit history of
these other classes, it Is expected that these amounts will be received when due. The Company and the Group does not hold any
collateral in relation to these receivables.

(c) Liquidity risk

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding through an
adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet obligations when due and to close out market positions. At the end of the reporting
period the Group held deposits at call of USD Nil (2022 - USD Nil) that are expected to readily generate cash inflows for managing liquidity
tisk, Que to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, the Group treasury maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability
under committed credit lines.

Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Company's and the Group's liquidity reserve (comprising the drawn borrowing facilities
elow) and cash and cash equivaients [(note 4(c)] on the basis of expected cash flows.

(i) Financing arrangements
The Company and Group had access to the following drawn borrowing facilities at the end of the reporting period:

49 Summary of significant accounting policies (Contd)
{b) Foreign currency trans lation

(i) Functional and presentation currency

items included in the financial statements of the Company and the Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency’). The financial statements are presented in United State Doltars (US
Dollars’), which is the Group's functional and presentation currency, since the entity uses US Dollars in majority of their transactions and it
reflects the economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances ralavant to the Group.

(li) Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign
exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement ‘of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at year end exchange rates are generally recognised in profit or loss.

Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings are presented in the statement of profit or loss, within finance costs. Atl other
foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the statement of profit or loss on a net basis within other income or other expenses.

Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair
value was determined. Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried at feir value are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.
For example, translation differences on non-monetary assets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss are
recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss and translation differences on non-monelary assets such as equities
classified as fair value through OCI financial assets are recognised In other comprehensive income.

{c) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised for the major business activities using the methods outlined below.

The Company and Group recognises the revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future
economic benefits will flow to the entity and specific criteria have been met for each of the activities as described below. The amount of
revenue is not considered to be reliably measurable until all contingencies relating to the sate have been resolved. The Company and
Group bases its estimates on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and the specifics of
each arrangement.

The sales includes providing manufacturing services, which were conducted under a transfer pricing agreement. Further, providing apparel
design service provider to the wider group In Sai Lanka

Several types of sates streams have been provided by the Company and Group. Revenue from manufacturing services under

local intercompany sales represent the cut and making services provided to its inter companies focally which were conducted under a
transfer pricing agreement where the final products are exported by the relevant customers, The revenue from manufacturing services
under direct exports represent manufacturing services provided to a foreign affiliate. No significant element of financing is deemed present
as the sales are made with a credit term of 30 days,

Revenue is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered and assessed on the basis of the actual service
provided as a proportion of the total services to be provided.

(d) Income tax
(i) Current tax

The income tax expense of credit for the period is the tax payable on the current pericd’s taxable income based on the applicable income
tax rate for each jurisdiction.

‘The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted at the end of the reporting periad in the countries where
the Company's subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in
tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where
appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

C)) Deferred tax

Deferred Income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they
arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax Is also not accounted for if it arises from Initial recognition of an asset or
(iabllity in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or
lass. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the
reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is
settled.

419 Summary of significant accounting policies (Contd)

(d) Income tax (Contd)
@) Deferred tax (Contd)

Deferred tax assets are recognised onty If it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences
and unused carried forward tax losses.

Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments
in foreign operations where the Company Is able to contro! the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the
deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax fiabilities are offset where the entity has a legally
enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or toss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive
income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly In equity, respectively.

(e) Impairment of assets

Goodwill and intangible assets thal have an Indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested anqually for impairment, or
more frequently if events or changes in circumstances Indicate that they might be impaired. Other assets are tested for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, An impairment loss is recognised
for the amount by which the assel’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's
fair value less costs of disposal and value In use. For the purposes of assessing Impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for
which there are separately Identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash Inflows from other assets or groups of assets
(cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the
impairment at the end of each teporting period.

{f) Cash and cash equivalents

For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held al call with
financial Institutions, other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or tass that are readily convertible to
known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown
within borrowings in current liabilities in the balance sheet.

(g) Trade receivables
Trade receivables ara recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method,
less provision for Impairment.
(h) Investments and other financial assets
() Classification
From 1 April 2020, the Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:
. those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through OCI or through profit or loss), and
- those to be measured at amortised cost.
The classification depends on the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.

For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For investments in equity instruments
that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Company has made an irrevocable classification at the time of initial
recognition to account for the equity Investment at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI.

The Group reciassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.

49 Summary of significant accounting policies (Contd)

(i) Investments and other financial assets (Contd)

(i) Recognition and derecognition

Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the Group commits to purchase or
sell the assel. Financial assets are deracognised when the fights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been
transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.

{ili) Measurement

At initial recognition, the Group measures 4 financial assets at its fair vatue plus, in the case of a financial assets not at fair value through
profit or toss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial assets. Transaction costs of financial
assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.

Finanrial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in thelr entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment
of principal and interest.

Debt instruments

Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow
characteristics of the assel. There are three measurement categories into which the Group classifies its debt instruments:

- Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal
and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest Income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective
interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit ar loss and presented in other gains/(losses)
together with foreign exchange gains and iosses. impairment losses are presented as separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.

- FVOCI: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets’ cash flows
represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are taken through ocl,
except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in
profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or toss previously recognised in OCI Is reciassified from equily
to profit or loss and recognised in other gains/(losses). Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the
effective Interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in other gains/(losses) and impairment expenses are
presented as separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.

- FVTPL: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. A gain or loss on a debt investment that
is subsequently measured at FVPL Is recognised in profit or loss and presented net within other gains/{losses) in the period In which it
arises.

Equity instruments

The Group subsequently measures all equity Investments at fair value. Where the Group's management has elected to present falr value
gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss
following the derecognition of the investment. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other income
when the Group's right to receive payments is established.

Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL ara recognised in other gains/(losses) in the statement of profil of loss as applicable.
Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments measured at FVOCI are not reported separately from other
changes in fair value.

{iv) Impairment

From 1 January 2020, the Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments
carried at amortised cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in
credit risk.

49 Summary of significant accounting policies (Contd)

(j) Derivatives and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered Into and are subsequently remeasured to their
fair value at the end of each reporting period. The accounting for subsequent changes In fair value depends on whether the derivative Is
designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Company designates certain derivatives as either:

- hedges of the fair value of recognised assets of liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedges).

- hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of recognised assets and liabilities and highly probable forecast
transactions (cash flow hedges), or

- hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation {net investment hedges).

Atinception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items
including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging Instruments are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items.
The Company documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions.

The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is
more than 12 months; it is classified as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12-months.
Trading derivatives are classified as a current asset or liabillly.

() Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
Cartain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instrument that does not
quality for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in profit or loss and are included in other income or other expenses.

(k) Financial guarantee contracts

Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as a financial liability at the time the guarantee is issued. The liability is initially measured at
fair value and subsequently at the higher of

. the amount determined in accordance with the expected credit loss model under SLFRS 9 Financial Instruments and

«the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the
principles of SLFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

The fair value of financial guarantees is determined as the present value of the difference in net cash flows between the contractual
payments under the debt instrument and the payments that would be required without the guarantee, or the estimated amount that would
be payable to a third party for assuming the obligations.

19 Summary of significant accounting policies (Contd)

(I) Property, plant and equipment
(i) Initial and subsequent measurement

The Company and Group accounting policy for land and buildings is explained in note S(a}. All other property, plant and equipment is stated
at historical cost tess depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Cost may
also include transfers from equity of any gains or tosses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and
equipment.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable
that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the Group. All other repairs and maintenance are
charged to the statement of comprehensive income during the financial period In which they are Incurred.

Cost of long term capital projects are carried forward in capital work-in-progress until the projects are completed and the related assets are
available for use.
(Ul) Depreciation

Depreciation is calculated on the straight line method to write off the cost of each asset to their residual values over their estimated useful
lives commencing from the month in which the asset Is available for use. On disposal of assets depreciation is calculated exclusive of the
month in which disposal takes place.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

Years
Buildings $0
Lease hold improvements 10 years or life of lease if tower
Plant and machinery 7to10
Furniture and fittings 5-10
Other equipment 5
Motor vehicles 5
IT equipment 4
Office equipment 5

Land is not depreciated as It is deemed to have an indefinite life.

Gains and tosses on disposal of properly, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceads with the carrying amount and
are taken into account in determining operating profit.

(m) Intangible assets

(i) Computer software

Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs that are
directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Company are recognised as
intangible assets when the following criteria are met:

- itis technically feasible to complete the software so that it will be available for use

- Management intends to complete the software and use or sell it

- there Is an ability to use or sett the software

+ itcan be demonstrated how the software will generate probable future economic benefits

- adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete {he development and to use or sell the software are available, and
- the expenditure attributable to the software during its development can be reliably measured.

{!) Computer software (Contd)
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software development employee costs and an
appropriate portion of relevant overheads.

Other development expenditures that do not meet these crileria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously
recognised as an expense are not fecognised as an asset in a subsequent period.

Capitalised development costs are recorded as Intangible assets and amortised from the point at which the asset is ready for use, over
their estimated useful lives, which does not exceed four years.

(n) Consolidation
(i) Subsidiartes

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power
to direct the relevant activities of the entity. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible
are considered only if the rights are substantive when assessing whether the Group controls another entity, Subsidiaries are fully
consolidated from the date on which control Is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.

The Group applies the acquisition mathod to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a
subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests
issued by the Group. The consideration transferred Includes the falr value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration
arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent abilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially
at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any Non-Controlling Interest (“NC!”) in the acquires on an acqulsition-by-
acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the NCI’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree's identifiable net assets.

Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.

‘When initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the
Group reports in the financial statements provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. During the
measurement period, the Group retrospectively adjusts the provisional amounts recognised at the acquisition date to reflect new
information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and, If known, would have affected the
measurement of the amounts recognised as of that date. During the measurement period, the Group also recognises additional assets or
fiabilities it new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and, if known, would have
resulted in the recognition of those assets and fiabilities as of that date, The measurement perlod ends as soon as the Group receives the
information it was seeking about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or learns that more information is not
obtainable. The measurement period shall not exceed one year from the acquisition date.

if the business combination Is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the
acquiree Is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gain or loss arising from such remeasurement is recognised in the profit or
loss.

The excess of the consideration transferred by the Group, the amount of any NCI in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any
previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. If the total of
consideration transferred, NCI recognised and previously held interest measured are less than the fair value of the net assets of the
subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the profit or toss.

Inter-company transactions, balances, income and expenses on transactions between the Group's entities are eliminated. Profits and
losses resulting from inter-company transactions that are recognised In assets are also eliminated. When necessary, amounts reported by
subsidiarics have been adjusted to conform with the Group's accounting policies. The financial periods of the subsidiary undertakings are
same as that of the Company.

‘When the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value at the date when control is lost,
with the change in carrying amount recognised In consolidated profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of
subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously

their capacity as owners. The difference between falr value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value
of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gain or loss on disposals to NCIs is also recorded in equity.

(p) Trade payables

These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company prior to the end of financial year which are unpaid. The
amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycte of the business if longer) of
recognition. Trade payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 months after the reporting period, if not
they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Thay are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interast method.

(q) Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair vatue, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost,
any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs} and the redemption amount is recognised in profit or oss over the perlod of
the borrowings using the effective interast method.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that It is probable that some or
all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is defarred until the draw down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence thal it Is
probable that some or all of the facitity will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over
the period of tha facility to which it relates.

Borrowings are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The
difference between the carrying amount of a financial tiability that has been extinguished or transferred to another party and the
consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised In profit or loss as other income or
financa costs.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12
months after the reporting period.

(r) Borrowing costs
General and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are
capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use or sale. Qualifying assets are
assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale.

Other borrowing costs are expensed in the pariod in which they are incurred.

{s) Provisions
Provisions for legal claims, service warranties and make good obligations are recognised when the Company has @ present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the
amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. .

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering
the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the
same class of obligations may be small.

Provisions are measured at the present value of management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at
{he end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The Increase In the provision due to the passage of time is
recognised as interest expense.

such as years of service and compensation. The defined benefit plan comprises the gratuity provided under the Act No 12 of 1983.

The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit ptan is the present value of the defined benefit
obligation at the end of the reporting period. The defined benefit Obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the
projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash
outflows using the yield rate of the long term government bonds that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related
defined benefit obligation.

The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and included in
employee benefit expense in the profit or loss.

Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions ate charged or credited to
equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise and will not be reclassified to the profit or loss. They are included In
retained earnings in the statement of changes in equity and in the balance sheet.

Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit or loss.

The assumptions based on which the results of the actuarial valuation was determined, are included in note 5(e) to the financial
statements.

20 Impact on economic crisis
Impact on the recent economic downturn to financial statements are as below.

Adverse movement on the foreign exchange rate
The Sri Lankan rupee has depreciated significantly during the year ended 31 March 2023 and it was under pressure due to the continuous
deterioration of the balance of payments and the depletion of foreign reserves. The Company earns its revenues in foreign currency, it is

the management's view that the Company is not significantly exposed to the prevailing economic conditions In Sri Lanka in a manner that
would impact its ability to continue as a going concern.

Effect of increase in Inflation rate

Sti Lanka has experienced a significant YoY inflationary impact as per the CCPI. This is mainly due to the Increase in import prices and
domestic prices resulting from rupee depreciation and excessive money printing by CBSL. The Company earns its revenue in foreign
currency and there is no significant effect due to an Increase in inflation even though there will be some direct and indirect consequences in
the areas of repair maintenance, material purchase, payroll costs and transportation costs etc.

Effect of increase In interest rates

The Central Bank of Sti Lanka has tightened the monetary policy by increasing its pollcy rates In response to the prevailing economic crisis
including the depletion of toreign reserves. It is assessed there will be no significant impact as the borrowings are in USD which are at their
maturity stage.

Global economic crisis

Global economic activity is experiencing & proad-based and sharper-than-expected slowdown, with inflation higher than seen in several
decades. The cost-of-living crisis, tightening financial conditions in most regions, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the lingering COVID-19
pandemic all weigh heavily on the outlook. Global growth is forecasted to slow from 6.0% in 2021 to 3.2% in 2022 and 2.7% in 2023. This is
the weakest growth profile since 2001 except for the global financial crisis and the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Global inflation will rise from 4.1% to 6.5% in 2022 and forecast to dectine to 6.5% in 2023 and to 4.1% by 2024.
